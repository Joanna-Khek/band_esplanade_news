29 Apr 2023, Sat, 10pm",,,"Esplanade Concert Hall (28 Apr), Esplanade Concourse (29 Apr)","Byzantine music in the Greek Orthodox Church is regarded as “the history of prayer through song.” Music occupied a central place in the Byzantine Empire (eastern Rome after the fall of Constantinople), especially in the churches. While not much survives of secular music, sacred liturgical music is exceptionally well-preserved in the form of manuscripts, and through traditions passed down orally, which extend back to the rites in 4th century Constantinople. These traditions continue in the Greek Orthodox churches today.
  Rich in history, Byzantine chants retain their traditional elements but have evolved, as new chants, inspired by the divine, have been written and added to the canon. At this year’s edition of A Tapestry of Sacred Music, theologian, priest, choir director and soloist, and proponent of Byzantine music Nikodimos Kabarnos and his ensemble Isokrates present biblical stories from the Old and New Testaments in the 2000-year-old tradition of Byzantine music.

  About the Greek Orthodox church and Byzantine chants
When the Roman Empire split into the western and eastern halves, the eastern half was the strongest power in Europe until the fall of its capital Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. That eastern half was the Byzantine Empire. As the Christians of Western Europe came to be known as ‘Roman’ Catholic, the Christians in Eastern Europe—from churches that Jesus’ apostles founded in the Balkans and the Middle East during the first century A.D.—came to be known collectively as Eastern ‘Greek’ Orthodox.
  While both the Gregorian (Roman catholic) and Byzantine chant are exclusively vocal (without accompanying instruments), and monophonic (having a single melody line), there are distinct differences between the two. Because of its location, the Byzantine Empire was influenced by Coptic, Armenian, Persian and later on, Islamic cultures. These influences inadvertently found their way into Byzantine art and music, even the music of the church.
  Contents of the chants differ as well: while the text for the Gregorian chant focuses mainly on praise, glorification and petition for mercy, some of the Byzantine chant forms (like the Kontakion, a narrative-sermon that explains the meaning of biblical texts) draw on the imagery and stories of historical narratives. Many of these contain conversations between characters, with a focus on the drama.
  This is a dialogue between Mary (known as Theotokos in Greek) and the Magi, after the birth of Jesus from a 6th century Kontakion, written by St Romanos the Melodist:
  She hears the Magi seeking the new-born Babe.
And at once she cries aloud, “Why did you set out?”
They answer: “Why have you brought forth
A young child such as this?
Who is your father, who is your mother
That you became mother and nurse of a fatherless son?
Seeing his star we know that he is revealed as
A little child, He who from eternity is God.”"

1 May 2023, Mon, 5.45pm",,,"Esplanade Concourse, Esplanade Concert Hall","The lama (title for teacher in Tibetan Buddhism) wields a damaru—an hour-glass drum; with a twist of the wrist, two strung beads hit the sides of each drum head alternatingly, creating an even, plodding rhythm. In his left hand, a brass bell chimes in time, accentuating each beat with a clear ring that penetrates the mind of the listener.
  Developed by the deified female yogi Machig Labdrön in the 11th Century, chöd (means “to cut”) is a Tibetan spiritual practice that aims to sever one’s attachment to the ego. Despite its profound metaphysical intent, the songs used in chöd are some of the most melodious in Tibetan sacred music. In being pleasing to the ears, the music is meant to draw in both living and spiritual beings to attend and benefit from the ritual.
  Encounter the restorative experience of chöd through the tantric songs used in two spiritual practices, the Dorje Tholu puja and Terma Lay Jang. Performed by the monks of Sangngag Choekhor Dargyeling Monastery, which is known for its healing ceremonies, the songs used in these practices are well-loved for the beauty of their melodies and their ritual significance.

Experience the beautiful and delicate vocal ornamentation and texture of a solo monastic in performance of excerpts of the Terma Lay Jang. The Terma Lay Jang is a collection of teachings that includes healing rituals. It is associated with grander occasions, such as Black Dakini Day (a day dedicated to the Black Dakini or Dark Goddess, a wrathful manifestation of the deity of wisdom who represents the transformation of negative emotions into wisdom).
  Chöd: A Tibetan spiritual practice
Through the esoteric rituals, meditation, song and visualisation, practitioners believe that impulse to cling onto the worldly phenomena of samsara (the cycle of death and rebirth) is obliterated. In chöd, gods and demons are not literal beings but the mental emanations—anger, ignorance, desire, and fear—that hinder one’s liberation.
  The lyrics are received through revelation—they are a corpus of hidden teachings and texts that manifest themselves to a lineage of masters called tertöns (treasure revealers), at the right time and place for the revelation to take place.
  I, a fearless Yogin in spiritual practice
know samsara and nirvana as equal
Dance upon ego-clinging gods and demons
Grinding dualistic samsaric thought to dust

– Laughter of the Dakinis, Chöd text
  A chöd ritual can be a daily monastic practice, though more elaborate forms of the ritual can be performed during feast days such as the monthly commemoration of the dakinis—divinity in the female form. Notably, they are sometimes they are performed in cremation grounds, which are ideal locations to summon forth mental states associated with an attachment to the mortal body."

With Arnhem Land’s proximity to water, water is a key element in the clan’s dances and songs, which mark major events such as celebrations or deaths. When these occur, the entire community mourns or celebrates with the family. One such ritual is Ayanjanarri, the Water Ceremony, which carries the sorrow and pain of many generations, and a totem is sung to cleanse the mourning family after a death.
  Listen to the improvisation of Ayanjanarri, the Water Ceremony
  Hidden away for centuries, these sacred dances and songs are now showcased to the world, thanks to songman and dancer Ngulmiya Nundhirribala, a revered leader in his community and keeper of the tradition. Experience these ceremonies at this year’s edition of A Tapestry of Sacred Music, where Nundhirribala, accompanied by piano and string quartet, will perform traditional songs depicting his family’s relationship with the Makassan sailors (from what is now Indonesia) and previously private ceremony songs.
  These songs were recorded for his new album, backed by the 40-piece Budapest Art Orchestra and contemporary classical composers Luke Howard and Anthony Gray. A one-of-a-kind artist, Nundhirribala wrote these songs by improvising over his clan's ceremony songs, such as Ayanjanarri (Water totem) and Gurumburra (Seagull totem), showcasing his incredible ability to improvise and collaborate using his traditional vocal style and language.
  About the Nundhirribala Clan
In the barren land at dusk, accompanied by the sound of lively chanting and clapsticks clapping, the men dance, holding flag posts with numerous triangular red flags and kicking up the sand. They wear red loincloths, their bodies are streaked white with ochre, marking the positions they hold in their tribe, totemic duties and ancestors. As nightfall approaches, the womenfolk dance in a group, their actions telling the stories of their history. The ceremony goes on for days, after which, the body painting is smeared, just as designs on the ground are obliterated by the stamping of feet during the dances. These are the Red Flag dancers of the Nundhirribala Clan.
  Watch the Red Flag Dancers
  The Nundhirribala Clan is one of many Australian indigenous tribes, who inhabit the remote Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. As early as the 1700s, Makassan fishermen sailed from the island of Sulawesi to Arnhem Land to trade, in search of trepang (sea cucumbers) in exchange for coins, clay pipes and alcohol. A record of these friendships turned into a culture and spirituality: the red flags symbolise the sails of the old perahu sailing boats and commonalities in language—jaga (to take care), mabuk (drunk), and Dhumbala/Dumala (sail). This culture is passed down generations through aural and oral tradition."
Music,Pipe Organ Recital – One Hundred Years of French Sacred Music,https://www.esplanade.com/whats-on/festivals-and-series/festivals/2023/a-tapestry-of-sacred-music/events/pipe-organ-recital-one-hundred-years-of-french-sacred-music,Maurice Clerc (France),"30 Apr 2023, Sun, 3pm",,,Esplanade Concert Hall,"Soaring, majestic, powerful, stirring—these are the words so often used to describe the sound of music played on an organ, an instrument that dates back to the 3rd century BC. It was at first an instrument of royal patronage, disapproved by medieval church leaders for its worldly and “sensually exciting sound”. Nonetheless, it eventually made its way into monasteries and churches. From the 14th to the 17th centuries, the tonal palette of the organ began to expand, and national styles of organ building also began to develop.
  Through the 18th and well into the 19th centuries, organ-building and performance flourished in France, advancing quicker than adjacent countries. Organ-building competitions encouraged builders to push the boundaries in design and sound – the addition of pipes that imitated orchestral instruments like bassoons, oboes, clarinets and flutes; and constructing the organ to produce a seamless swell of sound from soft to loud, which was previously impossible. The instruments of great organ builders like Aristide Cavaillé-Coll filled the knaves of the most famous churches in Paris, including Notre-Dame (whose organ was thankfully spared from the fire in 2019), L'église de la Madeleine and Église Saint-Sulpice.
  Influenced by composers like Liszt and Wagner, organist-composers were drawn to the instrument’s symphonic possibilities, and composer Charles-Marie Widor (1844–1937) had mentioned that “[the] modern organ is essentially symphonic [and] the new instrument needs a new language”. Widor and his successors, such as Louis Vierne (1870–1937) and Maurice Duruflé (1902–1986), thus set about composing “symphonies” for the organ. Dramatic and witty, they made use of the varying colours and timbres that the organ could produce. They brought together the vast and disparate elements of the French pipe organ into an “orchestra”, while staying true to the nobility and spirituality of the instrument.
  At the Esplanade Concert Hall, established French organist Maurice Clerc presents a programme covering the last 100 years of French sacred organ works. These pieces are written by some of the most influential organist-composers of the 19th and 20th centuries, and include improvisations by Widor, Vierne and Duruflé that were written for solo organ. One will experience the range, power and capabilities of the organ as a symphonic instrument through their works, while the masterpieces by Tournemire and Dupré showcase their unique blend of liturgical chants with modernist harmonies and techniques.

Music,Mehfil-e-Qawwali: Songs from a Sufi Shrine,https://www.esplanade.com/whats-on/festivals-and-series/festivals/2023/a-tapestry-of-sacred-music/events/mehfil-e-qawwali-songs-from-a-sufi-shrine,The Qutbi Brothers (India),"30 Apr 2023, Sun, 8.30pm
1 May 2023, Mon, 8.30pm",,,"Esplanade Concert Hall, Esplanade Outdoor Theatre","Qawwali is a Sufi expression of devotion, known as “path of the heart”. Qawwali’s present form can be traced back to 13th century India, when musician, politician and Sufi poet from the Chisti order in Delhi, Amir Khusru, wrote songs that combined elements from Persian, Turkish and Indian music to create qawwali’s signature, exciting sound. From hallowed shrines to bustling Bollywood, qawwali music and lyrics—it is Sufi poetry that is sung—have permeated the mainstream.
  In this concert, one of India’s most celebrated qawwali singers The Qutbi Brothers presents a rousing performance of this ancient devotional form, in multiple languages including Urdu, Punjabi, Hindi, Farsi and Arabic. With a lineage of over 800 years in the Sufi tradition passed on from the great mystics and saints, the award-winning The Qutbi Brothers are renowned for their distinct singing style and modern qawwalis. They are regular singers at the dargah (mausoleum or Sufi shrine) of Hazrat Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki, a Sufi saint and scholar who is regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of Sufism.
  About Sufism and qawwali
Sufism was born in 8th century Persia as a mystical expression of early Islam. Its adherents believed that love was a projection of the essence of God to the universe, and they sought to free the religious experience by focusing on man’s innate potential to experience this divine love personally and intuitively. For this reason, Sufi music and dance do more than express Sufi beliefs. They are themselves ways to experience truth and divine love personally. So instead of being something people perform or watch, Sufi music and dance are communal experiences that the audience participates in as fully as the musicians do.
  One such form of Sufi music is qawwali. Its origins are debatable but over the centuries, it travelled with the migration of Sufi mystics to take root in Pakistan and north India. Qawwali has since thrived and is sung regularly in a religious context at the shrines of Sufi saints.
  A typical qawwali performance is an interactive, fully engaging experience for both audience and musician, and may be described in this way:
  A qawwal, which is an ensemble of qawwali performers—lead singers, chorus singers, drummers, harmonium players—sits on the floor at the Sufi shrine. The qawwali begins with a line of melody, the singing of a poetic couplet. The qawwal assesses the audience for response. Building on the introduction, the qawwal launches into the main body of the qawwali, introducing rhythm at a moderate tempo. Slowly, the rhythm quickens and the vocals, handclapping and instrumentation intensify. The qawwal observes the audience, sensitive to any response. Here and here, they see faces glowing with rapture. A line gets members of the audience on their feet in dance and the qawwal repeats it with new vigour, varying and improvising with virtuosity, until the audience and they themselves are lifted to joyous heights.
  The qawwali repertoire: Sufi poetry
Poems of ancient Sufi mystics still make up the bulk of the qawwali repertoire and are sung in Urdu, Hindi, Farsi and Arabic. Today, they are not only associated with religious occasions, but have become a part of mainstream music. Qawwali is widely recorded, performed and loved as musical entertainment in Pakistani film and in Bollywood soundtracks—its traditional poetic lyrics of devotional, spiritual love re-interpreted as lyrics of secular love, and its mystic imagery used for dramatic effect. Nonetheless, the core of its practice still belongs at the shrines of Sufi saints, as a means to connect to the divine. Its rich store of philosophy, poetry and music continue to touch people who encounter it."

29 Apr 2023, Sat, 8.45pm",,,Esplanade Concourse,"Central to Islamic worship and devotion is the memorisation and recitation of the Quran, which is done through melodic reading of the text. More than mere singing, there are codified systems by which pronunciation and rhythmic cadence of every syllable are governed.
  Seven recognised lineages or recitation styles exist—known as qira’at, they were associated with different prominent reciter-scholars of the 2nd and 3rd centuries after the revelation of the Quran. These reciter-scholars came from the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, Damascus in Syria, as well as Kufa and Basra in modern-day Iraq; each of the seven lineages reflects the dialectic differences that existed amongst Arabic speakers of the time.
  In addition to the rules that ensure fidelity of recitation, emotion and beauty are woven into the vocal delivery of the sacred texts, through the usage of different musical modes known as maqam. Maqams are used in all music of the Middle East, and to most foreign ears, gives the music of the region its signature flavours. In Quran recitation however, the approaches of using the maqams are more specific, and they are chosen to create feelings of introspection, humility, steadfastness, or compassion, and selected to match the emotional content of the text.
  In this performance, Ustaz Ahmad Daniyal and Ustazah Aathirah introduce the seven recitation methods and highlight the differences in three qira’at: Riwayat Hafs 'An' Asim, the most commonly used and widespread recitation style often used for teaching the Quran; Warsh 'An Nafi', a style named after Nafi' al-Madani, a prominent scholar of Islam in the 8th century; and Khalaf 'An Hamzah', a recitation style is based on the narration of Hamzah al-Kufi, who was a student of Imam Ali (an important companion of the Prophet). Through this demonstration, the duo will also showcase maqams that beautify the melodies and portray certain emotions.
  Mastery of recitation for transcendence
Religious scholars further formalised rules of recitation called tajwid, which standardised intonation, phonetics and punctuation. This became increasingly important as Islam spread to more non-Arabic speakers—giving them clear guidelines on how to recite the Quranic texts in the way that the Prophet Muhammad was said to have pronounced them.
  Mastery over these sets of rules is expected by at least one member of every Islamic community, although it is a personal obligation of all members to practise it. Beyond rules and obligation, the recitation of the Quran is an art in itself, and in its aesthetics invokes in Muslims a profound sense of spirituality and transcendence."

1 May 2023, Mon, 5pm",,,Esplanade Courtyard,"From weddings to child-naming ceremonies, temple celebrations to music festivals, the loud and mellifluous nadaswaram (double reed wind instrument) paired with the penetrating thavil (barrel-shaped drum) are familiar sounds. Grand and evocative, sometimes boisterous, the music, referred to as mangala isai (auspicious music), is believed to sanctify ceremonies and bring heavenly blessings as it reaches the ears of the deities.
  When it comes to mangala isai, the instruments are inseparable. The coupling of the nadaswaram and thavil is a millennia-old tradition called mangala vaadhyam (auspicious instruments) that originated in Thiruvaiyaru, a town in Tamil Nadu. Some believe mangala isai originated from the Sama Veda, the third of four holy Vedic scriptures filled with melodic chants and hymns; others believe it has been around much longer.
  This performance gives you insight into the world of Carnatic compositions, through the melodious pairing of the auspicious instruments nadaswaram and thavil, in a performance of mangala isai, heard at almost all Hindu weddings and in temples of the South Indian tradition.
  Vidvans, devout musicians and singers
Mangala vaadhyam is associated with religious consciousness: the awareness of the divine and of others in the divine. There is a whole series of compositions that corresponds to specific temple rituals, performed at the start to set the mood.
  At South Indian temples, musicians get up as early as four in the morning to perform a wake-up call to the gods, and by bedtime, a lullaby. In between, they also provide accompaniment to each of the daily rituals, which range from announcing the arrival of the village deity, to replacing the idols with fresh garlands. Above all, they are required to know all the corresponding compositions, as well as purify themselves before, during and after playing.
Such is the discipline of these consummate musicians—called vidvans—who undergo many years of rigorous training at gurukul (schools) where they live and study under their gurus. Many of them belong to the Isai Vellelar community and are also known to be expert singers."

1 May 2023, Mon, 5.30pm",,,Esplanade Outdoor Theatre,"With roots in slave history and oppression, Santería is a syncretic religion of the African Diaspora in Cuba. Based on the beliefs and traditions of the Yorubas, one of the first West African ethnic groups to be introduced to Christianity on a large scale, Santería is a fusion of the worship of semi-divine spirits or deities called orishas, with elements of Spanish Catholicism.
  With a myriad of melodic gestures, rhythms, dance movements and praise songs to invoke the orisha or deity in this performance, the Yemaya Folklore Group explores the musical rituals of Santería, in which musicians were responsible for bridging the gap between heaven and earth.
  Clandestine practices of Santería
Santería (the Spanish word for “the worship of saints”) in its earliest days was once an exclusive slave practice that was shrouded in secrecy. It was an attempt at preserving their original religious practices, which were forbidden under yoke of subjugation. The devotees of the orishas had to disguise the worship of Yoruba deities, pairing the attributes of each orisha with analogous saints in Catholicism. This is how images of Catholic saints came to be displayed on the altars of Santería devotees.
  According to the faith, everyone is appointed his or her own orisha, that acted as a spirit guide which they could commune with through ceremonies known as the toques de santo. Music, chanting and dancing became central to worship, with percussion playing an especially vital role. Consecrated batá drums play interlocking rhythms, with each type of rhythm invoking different deities. Worshippers sing call-and-response songs in archaic Yoruba, led by the lead singer known as an apón, in an attempt to reach out to the spiritual world via spirit possession. The entire ceremony often lasts between four to six hours; and while may appear otherworldly, its function addresses the very real uncertainties and hopes of the community.
  From secret to secular
Today, Santería is gaining ground as an accepted and popular religious practice in Cuba and other parts of the world due to the mass migration of Afro-Cubans to the USA during the 19th century.
  Many well-known Latin musicians are Santería followers. Carlos Santana, for example, incorporated orisha-themes and rhythms into his songs, including Hannibal, which includes a Yoruba chant to the deity Shango. Another popular singer is Adalberto Alvarez, whose song Y Que Tú Quieres Que Te Den opens with an a capella rendition of a Santería prayer and makes references to orishas."

They wear red loincloths, their bodies are streaked white with ochre, marking the positions they hold in their tribe, totemic duties and ancestors. As nightfall approaches, the womenfolk dance in a group, their actions telling the stories of their history. The ceremony goes on for days, after which, the body painting is smeared, just as designs on the ground are obliterated by the stamping of feet during the dances. These are the Red Flag dancers of the Nundhirribala Clan.
  Watch a video of the Red Flag Dancers
  At A Tapestry of Sacred Music, songman and dancer Ngulmiya Nundhirribala, a revered leader in his community and keeper of the tradition, accompanied by his son Nayurryurr on didgeridoo, perform Dhumbala (Red Flag) songs among other traditional songs that are derived from hundreds of years of cultural exchange with Makassan sailors from East Indonesia. They also present their family’s totems and songs about the first contact with the outside world.
  The songs are sung in Wubuy, a severely endangered Australian aboriginal language, mixed with words that have merged from old Indonesian and Southeast Asian languages over centuries of trade and cultural exchange.
  About the Nundhirribala Clan
Hailing from the remote Arnhem Land, Northern Territory in Australia, the Nundhirribala Clan is one of many Australian indigenous tribes, who make up the original inhabitants of the land hundreds of years before colonisation in the 19th century.
  As early as the 1700s, Makassan fishermen sailed from the island of Sulawesi to Arnhem Land to trade, in search of trepang (sea cucumbers) in exchange for coins, clay pipes and alcohol. A record of these friendships turned into a culture and spirituality: red flags symbolise the sails of the old perahu sailing boats and they share commonalities in language—jaga (to take care), mabuk (drunk), and dhumbala/dumala (sail). This culture is passed down generations through aural and oral tradition.
  With Arnhem Land’s proximity to water, water is a key element in the clan’s dances and songs, which mark major events such as celebrations or deaths. When these occur, the entire community mourns or celebrates with the family. One such ritual is Ayanjanarri, the Water Ceremony, which carries the sorrow and pain of many generations, and a totem is sung to cleanse the mourning family after a death.

30 Apr 2023, Sun, 8.15pm",,,Esplanade Outdoor Theatre,"Not much is known about the origin of qasidah, but it is believed to be one of the oldest, most formal and esteemed forms of poetry in the Islamic world. With roots in pre-Islamic tribal and court poetry, qasidah, derived from the verb qasada, means “to intend” or “aim at”. A poem can run up to more than 100 verses, and is arranged to a single rhythm metre and rhyme scheme. From Arabia, it spread through religion, trade and conquests to Persia, North and East Africa, Central and Southeast Asia.
  Historically, qasidah was written to be delivered in song. The oldest examples contemplate the poets’ circumstances, praises their tribe or patron, and carries a moral message. Over the centuries, qasidah evolved to express social ideals, political commentary and sometimes satire. Poems of religious praise also took prominence, with the most well-known of them being Qasidah Al-Burdah (Qasidah of the Mantle), written in the 11th century by Egyptian poet Imam Al-Busri.
  In this performance at A Tapestry of Sacred Music, the Singapore Haqqani Ensemble presents Amdah Nabawiyah (a term for Islamic music about the life of Prophet Muhammad), through qasidah as well as nasheed, another common style of Islamic vocal music usually performed without instruments. In contemplation of the poetry as it is sung, devotees seek blessings from Allah, as they express their love for him.
  The story of Imam Al-Busri
The story goes that Imam Al-Busri was stricken by semi-paralysis after a stroke. In his despair, he composed the Qasidah Al-Burdah in honour of the Prophet Muhammad. While reciting the poem in sincerity and concentration, sleep came over him during which he dreamt of the Prophet, who covered the poet with his mantle. Imam Al-Busri woke up from the dream, completely cured of his affliction. Ever since, the poem has been venerated by many Sunni Muslims, recited as well as used to decorate the walls of public buildings and mosques. Some believe that reciting the poem confers blessings in life, removing them of difficulties, cures against illnesses and successes in different endeavours.
  From Arabia to Southeast Asia
In 1200CE, Islam and qasidah poetry spread across Southeast Asia with the immigration of Arab traders. The poems were sung in Arabic, with more popular ones, such as the Qasidah Al-Burdah, translated into the Malay language as early as before the 1600s. The text was sung in commemoration of Prophet Muhammad’s birthday, in rites of passage as well as weekly religious congregations. Shorter songs with verses taken from the original long-form qasidahs were also popularised in performance. The sung poetry is usually accompanied with frame drums such as the Malay rebana (equivalent of the Arabic daff), and the pear-shape lute, gambus."

29 Apr 2023, Sat, 6.45pm",,,Esplanade Outdoor Theatre,"“Korean dance is more than entertainment. It is an expression of a metaphysical philosophy. Koreans have traditionally believed that the human body is a universe unto itself and that man’s ideal existence lies in harmony with heaven and earth.” - Yi Bo-hyung
  Many of the festivals, cultural rituals, types of music and dances of Korea hark back to its agrarian past where farming was a common way of life, and the rhythm and joy of music and dance eased the hardship and monotony of planting, plowing, harvesting and husking. Rather than suppressing their feelings of sadness or struggle, Koreans overcame them through music, dance and prayer.
  Loosely translated as “to play four things”, the folk art form samulnori involves the playing of four percussive instruments: jing (large gong), k’kwaenggwari (small brass gong), jang-gu (hour-glass drum) and buk (barrel drum). The four together represent cosmic harmony: a belief represented in a Korean folktale in which a king, his two daughters and two sons save their kingdom from the ash monster by obtaining treasures from the four guardians of east, west, north and south. These four treasures are the percussive instruments that produce harmony when played together.
  Today samulnori is not practised as a way of life in modern Korea, but performed as a staged art, appearing on occasions such as festivals, parades and cultural concerts.
  Performing at this year’s A Tapestry of Sacred Music are advocates and practitioners of this folk art form, Variety E-SEO. The quartet presents a representative piece of samulnori, Binari, which was sung for happiness, health and wealth by troupes who travelled around villages. This performance is a prayer for global peace as well as the health and longevity of all festival attendees. The group will also perform Pangut, which demonstrates harmony and precision of its performers. See a variety of formations and brilliant movements, produced by the spinning the sangmo (a hat with feathers or paper streamers). The performance culminates in solo acts that showcase each performer’s skills.
  How samulnori came to be
Meant to motivate, farmers’ music (known as nongak or p’ungmul nori), usually performed by farmers’ bands, was typically rhythmic, vigorous and exuberant. It was also a form of folk ritual and entertainment. At that time, another kind of grassroots musical entertainment came in the form of the dramatic musical performances of wandering entertainers called sadang. Sadang (males were called “nam-sadang” and females “yo-sadang”) typically travelled to rural villages where they performed puppet plays, masked dramas, acrobatic stunts and shamanistic rituals. Their music and dances were absorbed into nongak over time and the recent result is what is now known as samulnori, a modernised fusion of nongak and sadang.
  The music of samulnori
The jing is a large gong that provides the basic beats and was, in ancient times, used to sound warnings to villagers or rally them together. The k’kwaenggwari is a small brass gong which leads all rhythm and tempo changes, while the jang-gu is a shoulder-held, double-sided hourglass-shaped drum which plays the most complex rhythm patterns. Rounding up the four, the buk is a barrel drum which plays the bass rhythms. Each instrument represents a natural element (lightning, wind, rain and clouds respectively); two of the instruments are metal or “yang” (symbolising masculinity and brightness) in nature, two are leather or “yin” (symbolising femininity and darkness)."
Music,"Sri Rejeki: Poetry of Sustenance, Provision and Sacred Blessings",https://www.esplanade.com/whats-on/festivals-and-series/festivals/2023/a-tapestry-of-sacred-music/events/sri-rejeki-poetry-of-sustenance-provision-and-sacred-blessings,Singa Nglaras (Singapore),"30 Apr 2023, Sun, 8pm",,,Esplanade Concourse,"Sri Rejeki is a selection of classical Central Javanese music played in the style of gamelan gadhon, featuring the softer instruments of the ensemble with an emphasis on the singing of poetry. Repertoires like the Sri Rejeki are part of a larger body of Javanese ritual and cultural practices that embody the linkages between people and the natural and spirit worlds, and such compositions are significant to Indonesia’s cultural heritage.
  Rejeki can be translated as sustenance, provision, or blessings. In this piece, the gerongan (male choir) imitates the croaking of frogs during periods of rain. For millennia in Southeast Asia, frogs have been associated with water, which is the source of life and fertility, and understood to bring rain; images of frogs are also found on bronze-age ritual musical instruments. Sri has multiple meanings, but it is also the name of the goddess of rice and fertility, Dewi Sri.
  This performance by Singa Nglaras Gamelan Ensemble features the musical compositions that accompany the sacred bedhaya dances of the royal courts, containing powerful mystical knowledge, and characterised by the singing of texts in a slow, archaic style. Before the main piece, the performance begins with Wilujeng (Wellbeing), a tradition that bestows blessings at the beginning of a special occasion.
  Sacredness of the gamelan
An ensemble of predominantly percussive instruments (gongs, metallophones, xylophones, drums, etc.), the Javanese gamelan is often played for pleasure and entertainment. However, it has always retained a sacred aura.
  Metallurgy has had a long history in Southeast Asia and the transformation of metal ores by fire has been associated with alchemy and religion. It is no surprise then that the forging of bronze or brass instruments for the gamelan requires special rituals. On these instruments, there is often decoration that features auspicious symbols of life force and fertility. Furthermore, all gamelan instruments are treated with respect—some bear respectful personal names, some are given offerings.
  Gamelan instruments and music are pusaka (heirlooms), so treating these instruments (and its music) with deference is akin to respecting the ancestors from whom they were inherited. The aura of sacredness surrounding gamelan music is also derivative of its associations with the auspicious occasions on which it is played, such as wayang kulit (shadow puppetry), sacred dances, ceremonies in the royal palaces, or village cleansing."
Music,Sampradaya Namasankeerthanam: Invocation of the Name,https://www.esplanade.com/whats-on/festivals-and-series/festivals/2023/a-tapestry-of-sacred-music/events/sampradaya-namasankeerthanam-invocation-of-the-name,Sri Rajaraman Iyer and Party (Singapore),"30 Apr 2023, Sun, 6.45pm & 9.15pm",,,Esplanade Concourse,"The act of singing the name of God, or namasankeerthanam, is a lively form of musical worship that took root in the south of India about two hundred years ago. The tradition is related to kirtanam (the Sanskrit verb of kirtan), an earlier practice from the north that glorifies and describes the attributes of Hindu deities through chant and song.
  In namasankeerthanam, a spirited congregation gathers, seated on the floor, led by a singer who calls out the name of their deity in short, melodic phrases. The devotees sing the name back at him, clapping their hands to the beat of the mridangam (double-headed drum) and kartal (brass hand-cymbals) in a call-and-response manner. The consciousness of the worshippers melds together through the repetition of the name of their beloved divinities.
  This communal exercise is typically practised on special occasions in the Hindu lunar calendar or on days that bear significance for their religious leader or guru. Namasankeerthanam is also sung in processions where worshippers travel on foot proclaiming sacred names, or by lone ascetics who sing as they seek alms for sustenance.
  Neither the melodies nor lyrics—repeating the name of the deity—are complex, as namasankeerthanam is meant for all devotees to participate in, regardless of their musical abilities. The belief is that in the current era of Kaliyuga, an age of vice and spiritual decline, the sincere recitation of the name of God is a way of expressing devotion and seeking salvation. The practice of namasankeerthanam thus allows worldly miseries and worries to fade away.
  While the songs encourage lay participation, worship leaders are often formally trained in classical Carnatic vocals, and in recent times the practice has taken on more performative presentations. From simple tents and function halls of temples, namasankeerthanam has now been brought onto larger auditoriums that accommodate thousands of devotees. Sometimes a percussion solo, which showcases the virtuosity of the mridangam or tabla player—a feature of Carnatic concerts—are incorporated as well. However, the core of practice is still a devotional one, and regardless of presentation format, aims to bring worshippers closer together to the divine.
  At this year’s edition of A Tapestry of Sacred Music, prominent torchbearers of this form of worship, Sri Rajaraman Iyer and Party, will perform two sets of namasankeerthanam. The first features the songs related to various Hindu gods, while the second set focuses on devotional songs for Vishnu, one of the principal deities of Hinduism."
Music,Life and Death: Hainanese Taoist Rituals,https://www.esplanade.com/whats-on/festivals-and-series/festivals/2023/a-tapestry-of-sacred-music/events/life-and-death-hainanese-taoist-rituals,Ling Bao Huang Tan (Singapore),"1 May 2023, Mon, 4pm & 5pm",,,Esplanade Concourse,"As early as 1821, Hainanese traders came to Singapore to trade goods such as wax, tiles, umbrellas, paper, and Chinese medicinal herbs. They came to Singapore in four various peaks, two of which were during the Opium Wars between (1839-58), and in the 1920-30s, unlike the other Chinese dialect groups (Cantonese, Hokkien and Teochew) who arrived earlier.
  Being a minority, they often sought each other out, through Hainanese temples and kinship clan associations where they could meet and mingle with fellow countrymen. While the newer immigrants were helped by clan associations in their search for work and lodgings, they would also approach the Hainanese temples to give thanks to the gods of the sea, who granted them a safe journey to Singapore.
  The Hainanese were mostly Taoists, and their ritual music and rites are similar to those of the Cantonese Taoists due to the geographical proximity to the south of China, except that the chants are in the Hainanese language.
  Today, there are a handful of Hainan Taoist priests in Singapore serving the Hainanese community who still hold on to their beliefs, and their roles are mainly ceremonial: the consecration of statues or altars, consecration/blessing of new houses, wishes for auspiciousness, funerary services, and ceremonies for the recently departed.
  These ceremonies often involve music, which draws on influences from the melodies in Hainanese opera and folk music. The suona is the main melody instrument in the ensemble, and is accompanied by the dizi and various percussion instruments such as the luo (small gong), ba (hand cymbals) and muyu (woodblock). Commonly seen at ceremonies is an altar of deities (the “Three Pure Ones”). These are the highest gods in the Taoist pantheon and regarded as manifestation of the Tao.
  Ling Bao Huang Tan presents two programmes of ceremonial ritual music for this edition of A Tapestry of Sacred Music. The first, performed during temple celebrations, is a Taoist blessing ritual where the sacred names of deities are invoked, and they descend from the heavenly realms to give blessings to the devotees.
  In the second programme, the priest summons the souls of the departed, and prays for their delivery from suffering before invoking the deities of the netherworld to bring them back to the altar where they can seek repentance and forgiveness from the divine."

1 May 2023, Mon, 7.45pm",,,Esplanade Concourse,"The Blessed Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus Christ, occupies a special place in the Catholic and Orthodox traditions of Christianity. In these traditions, the saints intercede for the living faithful on earth, and the greatest of saints is the mother of Christ. Her powers of intercession with her son Jesus were apparently limitless; murderers, thieves, and every variety of miscreant could turn to Mary to be saved from their well-deserved punishment. She was the key to heaven—the kindly Mother who would not fail to smuggle an erring child into Paradise—and her cult is strong.
  Devotion to the figure of Mary as an example for the faithful began early, being attested as early as the 2nd century A.D., and found its peak in the late Middle Ages, when stories of the miracles of the Blessed Virgin abounded and countless churches in France were named Notre-Dame (Our Lady) in her honour.
  Another strong movement around this time was that of the Troubadours. Composers and performers of Mediæval French lyric poetry and song, the Troubadours popularised the notion of ‘courtly love’, where a knight or nobleman dedicates himself to the service of a noble lady who ranked far above him, whose dignity, purity, honour, and kindness was praised extravagantly, and most importantly, unattainable and to be admired from respectful distance.
  In this milieu of Marian devotion and courtly love, appears Gautier de Coincy (1177-1236), a French abbot and troubadour, who compiled Les Miracles de Nostre-Dame (The Miracles of Our Lady) in which he set poems in praise of the Virgin Mary to popular melodies of his day. Courtly love is now transformed for a pious purpose.
  England and France are often thought of as culturally distinct today, but this was not always so. From the Norman Conquest of 1066, the ruling class of England were French or deeply Francophile, and the official language of the English court from 1066 till 1362 was French. From the 1340s to the 19th century, the monarchs of England and Ireland (and, later, of Great Britain) also claimed the throne of France. Even Chaucer’s prioress (a woman who is second in charge of an abbey) in the late 1300s spoke French as a means of social advancement. As such, trends from France were always strong in England, whether in art, literature, music, fashion, or indeed, religion.
  At this year’s edition of A Tapestry of Sacred Music, listen to a selection of Marian devotional and liturgical music taken from Gautier de Coincy’s songs (c. 1230), the Worcester Fragments (late 13th to early 14th century) and the Old Hall Manuscript (late 14th to early 15th century). Accompanying the voices are instruments, commonly seen to be played by the angels that surround the Virgin and Child in Mediæval depictions."

– Guru Granth Shahib
  In Sikh tradition, no ceremony, occasion or event is complete without the singing of kirtan, which is a devotional hymn in praise of God. A recognised form of congregational prayer, it has, according to the scriptures, the ability to cleanse the mind of all impurities physical and sensual; liberate one from the yoke of time and death; cast away disease, sorrow and suffering; and bring peace and bliss.
  Regulars at A Tapestry of Sacred Music, the singers and musicians from the Sikh Music Academy present the musical tradition of kirtan, which is the singing and contemplation of the hymns of the Sikh Gurus.
  Understanding the Sikh religion
In Punjabi, the word “sikh” means “disciple”, and central to the faith is the relationship between the Sikh and his master, who guides him through the teachings and writings of the 10 Gurus. Sikhism is rooted in oneness and love, and encourages a life of servitude and spirituality. It is the belief that in leading a good life, one must work hard and live honestly, treat everyone equally, serve others, be generous to the less fortunate, and keep God close in the heart and mind at all times.
  Hymns of Praise
Music is a central part of worship, with the religion’s 16th century founders being skilled poets, composers and musicians. The foremost of them was Guru Nanak, who wrote his teachings and revelations in poems, which he sang with his companion Bhai Mardana, a bard who played the rabab (a plucked string instrument).
  Over time, Guru Nanak's hymns as well as those of his nine successors were compiled into what became the Guru Granth Sahib, the sacred scripture of the Sikhs. In the book, the hymns of the Gurus are grouped under 31 raags or ragas, modes characterised by a specific series of notes and path melodies. Each raga has a name, an associated time of day or year when it is best performed, and a specific emotion it is meant to induce.
  In the hands of his spiritual successors and devout Sikhs, this musical tradition flourished as a means of spiritual elevation as they created and developed new ragas, styles and musical instruments. Continuing the tradition, the singing and contemplation of these hymns occur day and night at Sikh temples all over the world."
